Instructions on how to run your program.

To run the program, the user must have the jar on their laptop. Locate the folder
of the jar, type in java -jar Calendar.jar then --mode interactive (for interactive mode)
or --mode headless somefile.txt for headless mode. If they want to use the gui, 
then nothing needs to be typed. In interactive mode, you can type commands one 
at a time and see responses immediately and can end the program by typing exit.
Alternatively, headless allows a file with one command per line and must end
with an exit command to be inputted. The application will execute each
command in sequence and report errors.
